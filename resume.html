        I develop enterprise Java and Spring web applications and am passionate about the work I engage in. That passion has driven varied interests that I have incorporated into my professional portfolio ranging from the core Amazon Web Services product offerings, the Docker platform, and a healthy dose of DevOps tools and practices. Goal-oriented with a focus on the entire software development cycle. Oh, I also like maps and mathematics.
